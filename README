swift: the multiparty transport protocol
    (aka BitTorrent at the transport layer)
    Differently from TCP, the protocol does not use the ordered data stream
    abstraction. Effectively, it splits a file into 1KB packets and sends
    them around. The secret sauce is Merkle hash trees and binmaps.
 
    Requires libevent-2.0 or higher.

see doc/index.html for marketing stuff, ideas and rants
    doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-grishchenko-swift.txt for protocol draft spec
    *.cpp for the actual code
